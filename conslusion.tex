\section{Conclusion}

This article demonstrates the advancements in developing digital twins for
MegaScience installations, particularly focusing on the Siberian Ring Source of
Photons (SKIF). The developed prototype, which effectively simulates heat and
stress in the diamond window using COMSOL Multiphysics and Support Vector
Regression, marks a critical step in this endeavor. The transition from Python
to more efficient CUDA and C++ technologies has enhanced computational speed,
proving vital for real-time applications. Future work will expand this
prototype, integrating additional parameters such as simulating outputs from
thermometers and other sensors on the SKIF frontend. This evolution will
further the capabilities of the digital twin, providing a more comprehensive
and dynamic tool for scientific research and facility management.
